// Your task:
// 1. Use a Scanner object to instead ask the user for the money started with, the bet per spin,
// and the number of simulations
// 2. Calculate and print out the average percent gain or loss for each simulation
// 3. Calculate and print out the percent of simulations in which the user would run out of money
// 4. Calculate and print out the percent of simulations in which the user ends up with more
// than they started with
// 5. Calculate and print out the best and worst simulation results
// 6. Calculate and print out the total casino profit or loss across all simulations
// 7. If time permits, try another strategy as opposed to betting on a single number
